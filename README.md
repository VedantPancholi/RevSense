# 🚀 RevSense – Customer Feedback Analytics & Sentiment Insights Platform

**Revsense** is an end-to-end AI-powered platform that extracts, processes, categorizes, and visualizes customer reviews from multi-source platforms to generate actionable business insights. It combines advanced NLP, real-time automation, and LLM-based reasoning to transform raw user feedback into strategic decision-making tools.

## ✅ Methodology & Workflow: Point-wise Explanation

1. **🕒 Daily Review Scraping**  
   - A **cron job runs every night** to scrape reviews automatically from platforms like Twitter, Play Store, App Store, and MouthShut.

2. **🧹 Review Preprocessing**  
   - Reviews are cleaned using:
     - Tokenization  
     - Stopword removal (using **spaCy**)  
     - Lowercasing  
     - Removing punctuation

3. **🧠 Embedding Generation**  
   - Preprocessed text is passed to **Sentence-BERT** (`nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment`)  
   - This generates **dense semantic vectors (embeddings)** for each review

4. **🧭 Hierarchical Category Classification**  
   - We use **cosine similarity** between review embedding and category embeddings  
   - Reviews are classified up to **5 levels of category hierarchy**  
   - Total of **169 unique leaf categories** (e.g., App crash, Delivery delay, Taste quality)

5. **🔢 Category Count & Tracking**  
   - We **count reviews per category**, helping to identify which issues occur most frequently

6. **📊 Sentiment Analysis**  
   - Using BERT model to label reviews as:
     - Very Negative  
     - Negative  
     - Neutral  
     - Positive  
     - Very Positive

7. **📝 Summary Generation**  
   - For each **category**, a **summary** of the reviews is created  
   - Helps in quickly understanding the nature of feedback

8. **🧩 Chunking for LLM Processing**  
   - The summaries are **divided into chunks** before passing to **Gemini LLM**  
   - This helps manage **token size limits** and speeds up **processing time**

9. **📈 Insight Aggregation & Visualization**  
   - Insights are grouped by **category and sentiment**  
   - Displayed on a dashboard for **stakeholders** to interpret and act on
